# Single-cell-analysis
Single cell RNA-seq data used here is generated using the 10X genomics platform
Single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is a novel technique for extracting more detailed information from genome,scRNA-seq is useful in case of heterogeniety of cells and developmental studies.

Here files taken are GSM5712850_CC04_barcodes.tsv.gz as my barcodes.tsv.gz ,GSM5712850_CC04_features.tsv.gz	as features.tsv.gz and 
GSM5712850_CC04_matrix.mtx.gz as matrix.mtx.gz files.

And some of the plots are created such as dimheat plot,feature scatter plots, elbow plot etc.
